 ## Installing
Coming Soon
 ## For Contributors
1. [Get JUCE (Personal license is adequate, as the product is under GNU License)](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce)
2. Install VST SDK (This is the trickiest part, as Markov Brains supports both VST2 and VST3)
   1. Steinberg has finally depricated VST2, and a lot of DAWs still don't support VST3 \**angry glance at Ableton Live*\*. 
   2. Steinberg is also issuing DMCA takedowns for those that host the legacy VST2 SDK. If you need the SDK and want to contribute, please contact Kurt Yilmaz at kurtyilmaz@ufl.edu.
   3. Save extracted SDK to the following directory:
   
        | OS     | Directory |
        | ---      | ---       |
        | Windows | :C\SDKs         |
        | Linux/OSX     | ~/SDKs |        |
 3. Open "MarkovBrains.jucer" with the Projucer application downloaded
4. If an exporter for your IDE is not added to the project yet, add it via the "Exporters" tab on Projucer's sidebar.
